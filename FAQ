Do other block sizes make sense?  (2K, 4K, 8K)?

Larger block sizes offer three potential benefits.  First, they can result in
lower metadata overhead.  Second, they increase the "reach" of a given
width bitfield (a 16-bit field counting 512-byte blocks can address 32 MB;
with 8-kilobyte blocks it can address 512 MB).  Third, for a hash-based
system like undup, hashing larger blocks results in a lower RAM overhead
for a given input size.

The downside of larger blocks is that
