undup - compress files by consolidating duplicate data

undup tries to compress an input stream by watching for blocks that have
previously appeared.  It replaces the duplicated data with a backreference.
Integrity is ensured by validating a SHA256 across the entire stream at
reconstruction time.

USAGE

tar cf - dir | undup | xz > dir.tar.undup.xz
